EXAMINATION GUIDELINES



After you have completed the online English test, you need

 to click on the SUBMIT button at the bottom of the page. 

After you have done this, you will not be able to return to 

the question page to change any of your answers, so make 

sure that you have checked all of your answers before you 

finish to make sure you havenâ€™t made any silly mistakes.

When you go forward on to the next page, you will receive 

your results immediately: you will be given a score out of 40. 

Then you can compare your score to the SGI language level chart.

Your score will relate to a CEFR language level grade (A1, A2, B1, B2 & C1). 

However, this should only be used as a guide for your English competence. 

Normally in a school placement, you complete a grammar test and would 

also have a thorough interview with a teacher to truly assess your English skills.

An accurate assessment of your level needs to include speaking, writing, listening 

and writing, so this online English test is by no means a true and accurate 

appraisal of how good or bad you are at English.
